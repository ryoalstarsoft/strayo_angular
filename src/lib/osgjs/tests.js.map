Per Axis split (octree/ kdtree)\n// - Arbritrary direction split (bsp)\n\n// The algorithm used for splitting, the name for finding best split is 'Surface Area Heuristic (SAH)'\n// Octree divide the space in 8 subspace (one box -> 8 sub boxes)\n// whereas kdtree does it by splitting population number in two equal group\n\n// Kd Tree http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree\n// a given set of points is sorted along one Axis (e.g. X).\n// The sorted list is split at the median.\n// The result are two sets, one for each half-space (left and right).\n\n// Then, for the current node, the splitting-plane position (or the median-point) and depth is saved.\n// Finally, if the point-set has more than n point and the tree depth is below m\n// (with n,m chosen by the user, as build options), two child-nodes (L/R one for each point-set)\n// are created which themselfs repeat the pocedure.\n\n// The split-axis gets alternated at each depth, the split order is computed by checking the main\n// bounding box the length of its axis\n// **** GENERAL INFO ON KDTREE ****\n\n// The KdTree implemented here is flattened, ie, a node and its children all lie in the same array\n// The most
